- Make sure you're dragging the INDEX.HTML FILE, not the folder
- Try using Chrome or Firefox browser
- Make sure the file is less than 100MB (yours is only 77KB, so OK)
- Try refreshing the Netlify Drop page

If app doesn't work after deployment:
- Your Supabase credentials are already embedded
- Everything should work immediately
- If issues, check browser console (F12)
